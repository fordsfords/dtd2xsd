# dtd2xsd

The [dtd2xsd.pl](dtd2xsd.pl) tool was obtained from
https://www.w3.org/2000/04/schema_hack/ on 27-Dec-2018.
I took a snapshot of that page which can be found in the file
[DTD2Schema.html](DTD2Schema.html), and which can be rendered at:
https://fordsfords.github.io/dtd2xsd/DTD2Schema.html
My copy is only an archive/snspshot; please go to the
[original page](https://www.w3.org/2000/04/schema_hack/) for its
official content.

As of this date, that page lists the copyright as follows:

The program is Copyright © W3C® and provided under the
[W3C Software License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software).
I put the text in that page into [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt).

I ported dtd2xsd to GitHub because I wanted some changes and it doesn't
seem very likely that after 18+ years of no attention the W3C will
update the official copy.  :-)
